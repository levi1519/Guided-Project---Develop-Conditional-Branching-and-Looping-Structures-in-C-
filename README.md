# 🐾 Contoso Pets Adoption Application (C# Guided Project)

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository documents the development of the **Contoso Pets Adoption Application**, a console application designed to manage pet data (dogs and cats) and assist in finding them new homes. This guided project is part of my certification training in C# from Microsoft Learning.

The core goal is to implement fundamental programming concepts, including:
* Multidimensional Arrays (`string[,]`).
* Conditional Logic (`if`, `switch`).
* Iteration and Looping (`for`, `do-while`).
* Input Validation.

## 💻 Current Progress (Iteration 1: Setup and Menu Structure)

| Feature Implemented | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Setup** | Variable declarations, `maxPets` constant, and multidimensional array (`ourAnimals`) initialized. | ✅ Completed |
| **Sample Data Load** | Populated initial data for 4 pets (Lola, Loki, Puss, c4) using a `for` loop and a clean `switch` statement for improved readability. | ✅ Completed |
| **Main Menu Structure** | Implemented the main menu using a `do-while` loop, ensuring the application repeats until the user types 'exit'. | ✅ Completed |
| **Menu Branching** | Created the core `switch(menuSelection)` statement with placeholder logic (`"this app feature is coming soon..."`) for all 8 menu options. | ✅ Completed |

## 🚀 Next Steps

* **Implement Menu Option 1:** Develop the nested loops required to iterate through the `ourAnimals` array and display all pet information.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET 6.0 (or newer)
* **Concepts:** `for` Loops, `do-while` Loops, `switch` Statements, Multidimensional Arrays.
